# Tinkle — Electrical Build, Step by Step

Electrical only (plumbing's covered). Do the steps in order. Each step: **wire it, then
check it.** Don't move on until the check passes. If a check fails, stop.

Two rules: **one thing at a time** (never power everything at once), and **the pump goes
on last.**

We build in two parts:
- **Part 1 — on the bench, with LEDs.** USB powers the ESP32; LEDs stand in for valves and
  the pump. Nothing here can hurt you or the hardware. This proves the firmware and your
  wiring.
- **Part 2 — real power and real loads.** 24V, valves, the safety relay, the pump.

## The pin map

The ESP32 is the brain. Each job is one numbered pin on the board (silkscreen labels like
`D13`, `G13`, or just `13`).

| ESP32 pin | Drives | Type |
|---|---|---|
| 2  | Onboard blue "alive" LED | built-in, nothing to wire |
| 13 | Zone 1 valve | output |
| 14 | Zone 2 valve | output |
| 16 | Zone 3 valve (hose) | output |
| 17 | Diverter — clean leg | output |
| 18 | Diverter — fert leg | output |
| 22 | Pump relay | output |
| 4  | Heartbeat → watchdog (ATtiny) | output |
| 36 | "Tripped" ← watchdog (ATtiny) | input |
| 27 | Flow sensor pulse | input |

`GND` = ground = the common "minus." Every part's ground ties back to the **same** ground.
The ESP32 has several pins labeled `GND`; any of them works.

## What a FET is (read once)

A **FET** is an electronic switch. The ESP32 can't push enough power to open a valve
directly, so each valve gets a FET: the ESP32 tells the FET "on," the FET lets the 24V
through to the valve.

The part is an **IRLZ44N** — a black plastic block with a metal tab and **three legs**.
Hold it with the printed label facing you, legs pointing down. Left to right:

```
   [ metal tab ]
   |   |   |
   G   D   S
 (gate)(drain)(source)
```

- **Gate (G, left leg)** — the control. Connects to an ESP32 pin (through a small resistor).
- **Drain (D, middle leg)** — the load. Connects to one wire of the valve.
- **Source (S, right leg)** — connects to **GND**.

Two resistors per FET:
- **100Ω** between the ESP32 pin and the Gate (protects the pin).
- **100k** between the Gate and GND (holds the valve **off** at power-on, before the firmware
  takes over).

When the ESP32 pin goes HIGH, the FET connects Drain to Source → 24V flows through the valve
→ valve opens. Pin LOW → valve closes. That's the whole trick, repeated per valve.

## Flashing the firmware

This puts the Tinkle software onto the ESP32. **Needs a computer with a USB cable — you
can't do it from a phone.** Do it once now; after that, USB also powers the ESP32 for all of
Part 1.

1. On the computer, install PlatformIO: `pip install platformio` (or the PlatformIO VS Code
   extension).
2. Plug the ESP32 into the computer with a **data** USB cable (some cheap cables are
   charge-only — those won't work).
3. In the Tinkle repo folder, run:
   ```
   pio run -e esp32 -t upload
   ```
4. Watch the serial output:
   ```
   pio device monitor -b 115200
   ```

**Check:** the onboard **blue LED blinks ~once a second.** That's the firmware running.
If the upload can't find the board, it's usually the USB cable or a missing USB driver
(most DevKitC boards are CP2102 or CH340 — install that driver for your OS).

# Part 1 — Bench test with LEDs

LED legs: the **long** leg is `+` (anode), the **short** leg is `−` (cathode).

## Step 1 — ESP32 alive
Already done by flashing: USB plugged in, blue LED blinking. That's it.

## Step 2 — one output drives an LED
Pick Zone 1 (pin 13). On a breadboard:
- ESP32 **pin 13** → LED long leg.
- LED short leg → **330Ω resistor** → ESP32 **GND**.

**Check:** on your phone, join the ESP32's Wi-Fi (`Tinkle-Setup`, or your network), open
`http://tinkle.local`, and start a manual run on Zone 1. The LED lights. Stop it — the LED
goes off.

## Step 3 — the rest of the outputs
Repeat Step 2 for each, same wiring (pin → LED long leg → 330Ω → GND):

| LED for | ESP32 pin |
|---|---|
| Zone 2 | 14 |
| Zone 3 | 16 |
| Diverter clean | 17 |
| Diverter fert | 18 |
| Pump | 22 |

**Check:** each LED lights only when you run that thing from the phone. Starting Zone 1
must not light Zone 2's LED.

> Done with Part 1 you've proven the firmware and know every pin works. Now the real power.

# Part 2 — Real power and loads

## Step 4 — the 24V rail
Wire the power supply and its protection. **Leave everything else unplugged.**
- AC mains → Mean Well **LRS-150-24** input (through an AC switch if you have one).
- LRS `V+` → **10A fuse** → your `24V+` rail.
- LRS `V−` → your `GND` rail.

**Check:** meter across the rails reads **~24V**. Switch off → 0V. Confirm `+` and `−` are
where you think they are; mark them.

## Step 5 — the 5V buck
The buck drops 24V to 5V (for the flow sensor and, in final assembly, the ESP32).
- `24V+` → buck **IN+**, `GND` → buck **IN−**.
- Leave buck **OUT** unconnected for now.

**Check:** meter the buck **OUT+ to OUT−** = **~5V**. If it's adjustable and reads anything
higher, turn it down to 5V now, before anything is connected to it.

## Step 6 — one valve on a FET
Build a single Zone 1 channel (pin 13). Wire the FET as in "What a FET is":
- ESP32 **pin 13** → **100Ω** → FET **Gate**.
- FET **Gate** → **100k** → **GND**.
- FET **Source** → **GND**.
- FET **Drain** → one valve wire.
- Other valve wire → **24V+**.
- **1.5KE30A TVS** across FET **Drain and Source** (banded end to Drain).

Keep the ESP32 on USB for now (its GND and the 24V GND must be the **same** ground — tie
the rails together).

**Check:** at power-on the valve is **closed** (FET off — that's the 100k doing its job).
Run Zone 1 from the phone → the valve motors open (~6–10s). Stop → it returns closed.

## Step 7 — the rest of the valves
Repeat Step 6 for each, same FET wiring:

| Valve | ESP32 pin |
|---|---|
| Zone 2 | 14 |
| Zone 3 | 16 |
| Diverter clean | 17 |
| Diverter fert | 18 |

**Check:** each opens only on its own command. At rest: zones closed, clean leg open, fert
leg closed.

### The relay modules (read once)

Each **1-channel relay module** is a small board with the relay, its driver transistor, and
flyback already on it — nothing to solder. Pins: **VCC**, **GND**, **IN**; the contacts come
out to a screw block **COM / NO / NC**. You use **two** boards — one pump, one safety.

Two setup steps per board, before wiring the pump:
- Set the **H/L jumper to HIGH**. Active-HIGH matters: at power-on the ESP32 pins sit LOW,
  and you need the relays **off** then — off = pump dead = fail-dry.
- **Bench-test the 3.3V trigger:** VCC→5V, GND→GND, tap IN to 3.3V — it should click.

Wire each board: **VCC** → 5V buck, **GND** → common ground, **IN** ← its control pin
(Steps 8–9). A pin going HIGH closes that board's COM–NO contacts.

## Step 8 — the watchdog + safety relay
This is the safety: it cuts the pump's power if the firmware ever hangs. Build it **before**
the pump.
- ESP32 **pin 4** → ATtiny heartbeat input.
- ATtiny "tripped" output → ESP32 **pin 36**, with a **10k resistor from pin 36 to 3.3V**.
- **Safety module** `IN` ← ATtiny **pin 6**; its `VCC`→5V, `GND`→common.
- Safety-relay **contacts**: `24V+` → **COM**; **NO** → a new rail, call it **`24V-armed`**.
  (Pump power comes from `24V-armed`, not raw 24V.)

**Check:** with no run going, meter `24V-armed` = **0V** (relay open). Start a run → it reads
~24V (armed). Stop the run, or unplug pin 4 → it drops to 0V within ~2 seconds.

## Step 9 — the pump (last)
- **Pump module** `IN` ← ESP32 **pin 22**; its `VCC`→5V, `GND`→common.
- Pump-relay **contacts**: **`24V-armed`** → **COM**; **NO** → pump `+`. Pump `−` → GND.

On the bench, use an LED or the spare (cracked) pump as a stand-in — **don't run water.**

**Check (the important one):** the pump only powers when **both** a run is going (pin 22 on)
**and** the safety relay is armed (Step 8). Pull pin 4 mid-run → pump dies. Switch off AC →
pump dies.

## Step 10 — the flow sensor
- Sensor red → 5V buck OUT+, black → GND.
- Sensor yellow (pulse) → **level shifter** → ESP32 **pin 27**. (The pulse swings to 5V; the
  shifter drops it to 3.3V so it doesn't damage pin 27.)

**Check:** spin water/air through it (or tap the pulse line) → the flow reading on the phone
changes.

---

## Final check — fail-dry

Everything wired. Confirm each of these makes the pump dead:
- Switch off AC → pump dead.
- Start a run, then pull the heartbeat (pin 4) → pump dead within ~2s.
- At power-on, before you do anything → all valves closed, pump off, blue LED blinking.

That's the build. Wet test (real water) comes later.
