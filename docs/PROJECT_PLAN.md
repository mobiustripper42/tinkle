# Tinkle — Project Plan

**Start date:** 2026-05-30
**V1 target:** Build target Winter 2026–27, running the 2027 season. Firmware has no
hardware dependency (DEC-004) — software phases proceed now; wet validation is
parts-gated.
**Critical path:** Actuation core + fail-dry chain (Phases 1, 5) proven on the bench
before any wet run.

---

## Estimation Method

Fibonacci scale (2, 3, 5, 8, 13). See `VELOCITY_AND_POKER_GUIDE.md`.
All estimates from planning poker between Eric and Claude.
Tests are baked into every task estimate — no separate testing tasks.

**Velocity** (per `/retro`, DEC-013 — `dev_time` is the forecast number; wall clock is break-inflated):

| Phase | Sessions | Points | Wall (h) | Dev (h) | Review (h) | hrs/pt (dev) |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|---------|------------|--------------|
| 0 | — | ~19 | — | — | — | scaffold — done pre-session-tracking, no time data |
| 1 | 2 | 31\* | 15.75 | 3.58 | 1.75 | 0.12 |

\* 31 = 25 Phase-1-labeled (#9–#14) + 6 spillover (Wokwi #7 [3, Phase 0], C++11 build-standard fix [2], TM1637 lib unblock [1]). Wall clock was ~66% breaks (toolchain download, a connection-drop gap), so treat Phase 1 as a **noisy baseline** — Phase 2 is the first clean read. Full detail in `RETROSPECTIVES.md`.

## Phase 0: Scaffold & contracts

Everything needed to develop safely off-hardware. No watering behavior yet.

| # | Task | Effort | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 0.1 | Repo, git, GitHub remote, `.gitignore` | 2 | [x] [#1](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/issues/1) |
| 0.2 | Seeds workflow install (skills, agents, `project-type=tool`, `seeds-version`) | 2 | [x] [#2](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/issues/2) |
| 0.3 | Docs: CLAUDE.md, SPEC, DECISIONS, PROJECT_PLAN; source specs vendored to `docs/` | 3 | [x] [#3](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/issues/3) |
| 0.4 | `platformio.ini` (esp32 / attiny85 / native) + `src/{esp32,attiny,core}` layout | 3 | [x] [#4](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/issues/4) |
| 0.5 | `pins.h` from `tinkle_wiring.html` §B | 2 | [x] [#5](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/issues/5) |
| 0.6 | Install PlatformIO; `pio run -e esp32` and `pio test -e native` green | 3 | [x] [#6](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/issues/6) |
| 0.7 | Wokwi sim config — boot the firmware in simulation | 3 | [x] [#7](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/issues/7) |
| 0.8 | Sessions branch + `.sessions-worktree/` | 1 | [x] [#8](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/issues/8) |

**Phase 0 total: 19 pts** — complete (most done at scaffold; #6 toolchain + #7 Wokwi completed in Session 2; all closed at the Phase 1 retro)

**Ejection point:** A clean repo that builds for both MCUs, runs host tests, and
boots in sim — every later phase is faster and safer.

## Phase 1: Actuation core

The safety-critical heart. Bench-testable on LEDs/scope; no water.

| # | Task | Effort | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1.1 | `ValveDriver` — latching pulse open/close, never-both-high invariant | 5 | [x] [#9](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/issues/9) · §5 |
| 1.2 | `ValveDriver` — diverter travel, master FET, pump relay, safe state | 3 | [x] [#10](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/issues/10) · §5 |
| 1.3 | `RunController` state machine (IDLE→…→SETTLE, fault unwind) | 8 | [x] [#11](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/issues/11) · §4; src/core, fake clock/GPIO |
| 1.4 | Non-blocking cooperative loop scaffold (tick ≤10ms, per-actuator timers) | 3 | [x] [#12](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/issues/12) · §2 |
| 1.5 | Buttons — debounce, edge events, single-active invariant | 3 | [x] [#13](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/issues/13) · §11 |
| 1.6 | TM1637 display — idle clock / MM:SS countdown / fault code | 3 | [x] [#14](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/issues/14) · §12 |

**Phase 1 total: 25 pts** — complete (all closed). Ejection point met: full master→zone→pump→countdown→unwind sequence runs button-driven in the Wokwi sim (#7).

**Unplanned work absorbed in the Phase 1 window** (not in the original plan):
- C++11 build-standard fix + native/esp32 `-std=gnu++11` lockstep — [PR #18](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/pull/18) (2 pts) · *Added during P1 retro*
- TM1637 lib unblock (delisted `avishorp/TM1637`) — [PR #20](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/pull/20) (1 pt) · *Added during P1 retro*
- Wokwi diagram pin-fix re-land (#22 merge race) — [PR #24](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/pull/24) · *Added during P1 retro*

**Deferred design item:** [#23](https://github.com/mobiustripper42/tinkle/issues/23) — 3-zone button model (each button runs its own zone, any-button-cancels, long-press fault-clear; DEC-006). Needs @architect + resolve **before** Phase 2 Persistence locks an NVS schema around zone count.

**Ejection point:** A simulated/bench run sequences master→zone→pump and unwinds
to safe state, driven by a button, with a live countdown.

**Phase 4 total: 24 pts**

---

## Phase 6: Bench validation + wet confirm

Parts-gated (Winter 2026–27). Does not block Phases 1–5.

## Estimation Poker — Standing Disagreements

| Task | Claude says | You say | Question |
|------|------------|---------|----------|
| — | — | — | — |

## Phase Boundary Checklist

1. `pio test -e native` green; sim/bench checks for the phase pass.
2. @pm phase retrospective — velocity check, timeline update.
3. Write retrospective entry in `docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md`.
4. Return to planning chat — review docs against intent.

## Cuttable Tasks (if behind)

| Task | Why it's cuttable | Defer to |
|------|------------------|---------|
| 1.6 TM1637 display | Status nicety; web UI shows the same countdown | later in V1 |
| 4.3 SPA polish | API + a minimal page is enough to operate; full 6-screen polish can trail | later in V1 |
