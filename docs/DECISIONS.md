# Tinkle — Architectural Decisions

Decisions are numbered DEC-NNN. "DEC-TBD" means the decision is flagged but
unresolved — consult @architect before building.

The hardware and firmware specs (`docs/tinkle_v1_spec.md`,
`docs/tinkle_firmware_spec.md`, `docs/tinkle_wiring.html`) carry the detailed
rationale for component selection and behavior. This file records the
project-shape and architecture decisions made during planning.

## DEC-001: One repo, two MCU build environments
**Decision:** A single repository with one `platformio.ini` carrying three envs —
`esp32` (firmware), `attiny85` (watchdog), and `native` (host unit tests). Sources
split by directory: `src/esp32`, `src/attiny`, `src/core` (platform-independent
logic), selected per env via `build_src_filter`.
**Why:** The ESP32 and ATtiny are bound by a shared contract — the watchdog
handshake (DEC-004). Keeping both binaries in one repo keeps that contract in one
place and one history. `src/core` holds the safety-critical logic so it compiles
into both the firmware and the host test runner.
**Tradeoff:** Two toolchains in one project; `build_src_filter` must stay correct
so the wrong sources don't leak into an env.

## DEC-002: SPA embedded as a gzipped PROGMEM bundle
**Decision:** The phone UI is vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, a single `index.html` gzipped
and embedded into flash (PROGMEM), served with `Content-Encoding: gzip`. No
filesystem partition, no build-step framework.
**Why:** No FS partition to manage, the UI ships atomically with the firmware
image, and a tiny static bundle (< 50 KB gzipped) is trivial to serve offline.
**Tradeoff:** A UI change requires a reflash. Acceptable for V1 — the UI is the
field-edit path, not a frequently-iterated product surface. LittleFS (OTA-able UI)
is the escape hatch if that changes.

## DEC-003: Single-wire watchdog encoding — heartbeat means "run active"
**Decision:** The ESP32 emits its heartbeat square wave **only while a watering
run is active**. "Heartbeat present" therefore means "a run is in progress."
There is no separate run-active line. The ATtiny holds the safety relay armed
only while (a) a heartbeat edge was seen within `HB_TIMEOUT_MS` and (b) continuous
armed time is under `HARD_MAX_RUNTIME`, timed on its own clock.
**Why:** The firmware spec §9 left the run-active encoding open and the wiring doc
(§B) allocates **no** run-active pin while captioning the heartbeat as "while
firmware healthy" — those two can't coexist (an always-on heartbeat gives the
ATtiny no way to bound run time). This resolves the inconsistency with **zero
hardware change**: keep the exact pin map, redefine the heartbeat semantics, and
document them in the ATtiny sketch header (done, `src/attiny/main.cpp`).
**Why it's safe:** Idle crash → no heartbeat → relay de-armed, which is the safe
state we want anyway (idle = no water; a missed cycle is harmless). Loop stall
mid-run → heartbeat stops → trip in ~2s. Logic-bug run-forever with the loop alive
→ software ceiling (`swMaxRuntimeSec`, 20 min) fires first; the ATtiny's 30-min
hard ceiling is the backstop. The ATtiny can never *cause* water — it only gates
power.
**Tradeoff:** The heartbeat conflates "firmware alive" with "run active." That
conflation is sound here precisely because de-arming during idle is desired.

## DEC-004: Firmware-first development; sim and bench before flash
**Decision:** Build and validate in tiers, deferring real hardware. (1) Native
unit tests on the host for `src/core` logic with fake clock + fake GPIO. (2) Full-
firmware simulation in Wokwi on the laptop. (3) Breadboard bench with LEDs standing
in for valves/master/pump and a pulse source faking the flow sensor — runs the full
§17 acceptance checklist. (4) Wet hardware (pump, valves, Dosatron, tape) as the
final confirm gate only.
**Why:** The flash/reflash loop is slow and the wet hardware arrives last (build
target Winter 2026–27). Most logic — including the safety-critical state machine —
can be exercised off-hardware. Bench stand-ins validate real silicon before water.
**Tradeoff:** Bench-tunable constants (`PULSE_MS`, `DIVERTER_TRAVEL_MS`, flow
K-factor) stay at seeded defaults until tiers 3–4 confirm them.
